# keg-party

`tap>`, party style!

## Usage

### Launch the server

Start your party by launching a server with one of the following options:

- `clj -X keg-party.main/run` from the cloned project
- Build an uberjar with `clojure -X:uberjar` then run it with `java -jar keg-party.jar`

By default, the server will run at `http://localhost:3333`. You can change these defaults as described in the
configuration section below.

When you connect to the server, you'll be directed to a login page:

![login.png](doc/login.png)

If you haven't created an account, follow the "Sign up" link to do so:

![signup.png](doc/signup.png)

Whether you are logging in to an existing account or creating a new one, you'll be immediately directed to the tap feed once you are signed in:

![feed.png](doc/feed.png)

Start playing around and have some fun!

### Connect your client

Invite all your friends to the party by doing the following:

Add `keg-party` as a dependency to your project. The suggested way is to add it to your `~/.clojure/deps.edn` file
  like so:

```clojure
 :deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
        com.markbastian/keg-party
        {:git/url "https://github.com/markbastian/keg-party"
         :sha     "2b9af40112378f371dece94f063fa2cb7566ca2e"}}
```

Configure your environment with the following environment variables:
- `KEG_PARTY_HOST`, defaults to http://localhost
- `KEG_PARTY_PORT`, defaults to 3333
- `KEG_PARTY_USERNAME`, defaults to `(or (env :keg-party-username) (env :user))`
- `KEG_PARTY_PASSWORD`, no default. This is your password from the setup page.
  - This is the only env var that you _must_ set if you aren't using the defaults.

Connect the tap target by invoking:
```clojure
(do
  (require '[keg-party.clients.rest-client :as kprc])
  (kprc/tap-in!))
```

For an automated experience, do the following:
- Create a local dev or user profile if you don't already have one
  - (e.g. add `:dev {:extra-paths ["dev"]}` to your `~/.clojure/deps.edn` `:aliases`)
- In that profile's extra paths, add a ns that looks something like this:

```clojure
(ns user
  (:require [keg-party.clients.rest-client :as kprc]))

(println "KEG PARTY TAPPING IN")
(kprc/tap-in!)
```

If you already have such a namespace, just add the above to it.

Ensure that this profile is active when you launch your REPL. When you do so, this code will be run and you are good to go.

Test your config you by doing something like this:

```clojure
(tap> {:best-drink-ever     :diet-dew
       :the-next-best-thing :diet-dr-pepper})
```

Head on over to your party server and see the data!

## Misc

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -X:test:runner

Build a deployable jar of this library (Still needs work):

    $ clojure -X:jar

## TODOs

- [X] Persistence
- [ ] Create protocols for db ops to hide implementation (e.g. users and taps)
- [ ] Add admin profile concept so that only admins can see client tabs, for example
- [ ] Expose favorites
- [ ] Drill-down/explore individual tap data
- [ ] Add args for deps so we can easily launch with -X args
- [ ] Add client profile so you can just add the profile and connect the tap at launch
- [ ] Documentation with screenshots
- [ ] User spaces/channels
